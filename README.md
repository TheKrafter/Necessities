<p>An opinionated reimplementation of EssentialsX, in Kotlin.</p>
</div>

#### Developer's Note: this plugin is a work in progress, a far off dream and ambition. It is nowhere near completion yet.

### Why?

While EssentialsX is a good plugin with many useful features, I feel the need for diversity in the plugin space, and a 
plugin that caters to different kinds of server admins. EssentialsX is often big and bulky, and when you don't need all 
of its copious features, it can be a hassle to hide commands or disable countless permissions. 

This plugin intends to solve the issues of EssentialsX, with the aim to be both elegant and powerful. It does this by 
organizing each set of features into its own "module" which can be completely disabled or enabled in their individual 
config file. On top of that, only a few modules are enabled by default, so you can just enable what you need.
